## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/birthday-wisher-automation.git
cd birthday-wisher-automation
```

### Update Gmail credentials:
To enable the script to send emails, you need to configure your Gmail account credentials in the script:

* Locate the following variables in the script:
```
GMAIL_ID = 'your_email@gmail.com'
GMAIL_PSWD = 'your_password'
```
* Replace the placeholder values with your Gmail account credentials:
  
GMAIL_ID: Your Gmail address (e.g., your_email@gmail.com).

GMAIL_PSWD: Your Gmail password.

**Important:** For enhanced security, generate an App Password and use it in place of your actual Gmail password. App Passwords are unique, application-specific credentials that allow access without exposing your primary password.

* Save the changes to the script to apply the updates.

### Prepare the data.xlsx file:

Create an Excel file named data.xlsx in the same directory as the script.
Ensure it has the following columns:
* Name: Name of the individual.
* Email: Email address to send the wishes.
* Birthday: Date of birth in DD-MM-YYYY format.
* Dialogue: Custom message to include in the email.
* Year: Leave this column empty initially. It will store the years when wishes were sent.

| Name       | Email                | Birthday    | Dialogue                  | Year |
|------------|----------------------|-------------|---------------------------|------|
| John Doe   | john.doe@gmail.com   | 01-01-1990  | Happy Birthday, John!     |      |
| Jane Smith | jane.smith@gmail.com | 18-11-1985  | Wishing you a great day!  |      |

### Schedule the script to run daily:
Use Task Scheduler (Windows) or a Cron job (Linux) to run the script automatically at midnight.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
#### SMTP Authentication Error:
* Enable "Allow less secure apps" in Gmail settings or use an App Password.

#### Cron/Task Scheduler Issues:
* Check permissions or verify the Python environment used by the scheduler.
